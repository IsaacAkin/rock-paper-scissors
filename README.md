## How It Works

- The player can choose between rock, paper and scissors. Clicking on a button counts as the players choice. The computers choice is randomly generated. On click, the outcome of the round is displayed and the scores are updated. The outcomes can either be win or lose with explanations on why (e.g. "You Win! Rock beats Scissors") or draw. The first one to 5 points wins and either a congratulatory message or a sorry message are displayed. The game resets upon a player reaching 5 points, allowing for the game to be played again.
